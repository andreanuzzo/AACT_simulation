Epidemiological model for contact tracing impact over the course of COVID-19 2020 pandemic

# Intro
Contact tracing has huge potential to limit and mitigate the spread of infectious diseases. In the recent pandemic of COVID-19, we are defining strategies to implement contact tracing through GPS location tracking and contemporarily preserve the privacy and safety of both patients and contacts at risk. 

This model starts from the effort of [Hellewell et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(20)30074-7).
